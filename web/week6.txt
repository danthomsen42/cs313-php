After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:

https://radiant-gorge-54637.herokuapp.com/cit_lab/displayMain3.php

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):

https://github.com/danthomsen42/cs313-php

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.

This retrieves and inserts data as intended for most of the information. There is no special login information.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

It works well as necessary for basic imput and output, but the queue table isn't quiet ready. It should be done here shortly.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

I basically learned how to actually use the database as necessary.

6. What is a benefit of having a foreign key constraint?

A foreign key is used to keep data in unique tables but use this data as necessary amongst the other tables for the sake of organization and security.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

C

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

I would say C, as it technically meets most of the requirements, but it is missing the main queue, which should just be contained partially in a queue table and mostly in a session variable.
